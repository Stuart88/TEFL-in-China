                            When we listen in our native language, we use skills that were acquired when we were very young, but these do not necessarily transfer automatically when studying a second language. There is also the added problem that students will be exposed to different accents, dialects and colloquial language.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            For this reason, it is important to understand some of the skills which will be needed if we are going to successfully teach our students how to listen.

                            Enabling skills are the skills we teach our students to enhance their ability to understand a speaker´s accent or pronunciation, their grammar, vocabulary, and meaning. An able listener can perform these four things simultaneously. Below are listed the enabling skills we try to help our students with, in order from easiest to most difficult:

                            Consider two separate conversations: in the first a friend is telling you about their weekend - you listen and make a few comments about how nice it must have been. In the second conversation someone is telling you about a party you are invited to - you listen very carefully to get the time and directions how to get there. The first is an example of top-down listening: you were listening for general information and made a few comments when expected. The second conversation is an example of bottom-up listening: you were trying to get specific information, namely the time and place of the party.

                            In order to develop top-down listening we give our students activities with general questions to listen for gist and to get an overall idea of the topic. To develop bottom-up listening students will be given tasks where they have to find specific information, such as the name of someone, the price of something or the time something will happen.

                            Extensive listening is when students are exposed to many types of inputs outside the classroom, at their convenience.

                            All students have different learning styles and varied tastes with regards to music, movies etc. What students choose to listen to for pleasure and general language improvement can have a huge impact on their language learning. This type of listening usually takes place outside the classroom in the students' homes, cars or when travelling. When students make their own choices about what they listen to, the motivational power of these activities increases dramatically.

                            Intensive listening is when students are exposed to listening in a classroom and have to find particular information. For example, listening to directions and finding out which building is being described on a map, or what time a concert starts. Materials for these listening activities can be found from any number of sources:

                        <Paragraph>
                            Listening can occur at a number of points in a teaching sequence. Sometimes it forms the jumping-off point for the activities which follow; sometimes it is the first stage of a 'listening and acting out' sequence where students role-play the situation they have heard on the recording. Sometimes listening may be a prelude to a piece of writing or a grammar presentation. Other lessons, however, have listening training or practice as their main objective.

                            A lesson where the main focus is on practicing listening skills should be organized into the following stages:

                            You need to set the scene and prepare your students for the listening input; 5 - 10 minutes should be spent on this sub-stage. Below you will find some sample activities.
