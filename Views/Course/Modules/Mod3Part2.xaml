                        <Paragraph>
                            Speaking is defined as the 'action of conveying information or expressing one's thoughts and feelings in spoken language' (dictionary.com). It is interesting to note that virtually no-one finds speaking difficult in their native language, yet many students find it one of the most difficult of the skills to learn in L2. It is also the main motivation for most students to want to study English in the first place – to be able to speak to other English speakers.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Speaking is more than just being able to produce sounds correctly or use appropriate stress and intonation patterns. Students will also have to learn to be able to use a range of conversational strategies, to be able to communicate in the different situations they may find themselves in.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            There are four skills needed to have complete command of a language and for effective communication to take place. In our first year of life we develop listening skills first, then speaking (14 months of age), then we go to school and begin to learn reading and writing.

                            These are called the four basic language skills. When we teach English based on The Communicative Approach, we develop these fours skills simultaneously.

                            There are receptive skills and productive skills. Receptive skills are Listening and Reading since you are receiving information. Productive skills are Speaking and Writing since you are producing information verbally or in written form. Grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary and spelling are sometimes called sub-skills. You will now learn how to develop these four skills and how to plan your lessons according to each skill.

                        <Paragraph>
                            When developing speaking skills you need to know that it is more than just being able to pronounce sounds correctly or use appropriate stress and intonation patterns. Along with the need to survive in typical functional exchanges, students will have to be able to use a range of conversational strategies, as well as a number of different genres and situations.

                            Different speaking events
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            When discussing speaking events, we can make a distinction between transactional and interpersonal functions as they relate to describe different speaking situations. The main purpose of transactional functions is in its conveying of information and facilitating the exchange of goods and services. Interpersonal functions, however, is all about maintaining and sustaining good relations between people.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            However we choose to describe the purpose of the speaking event, it is one that we can characterize as interactive or non-interactive. When we buy a newspaper or a bag of milk in a store, it's interactive, whereas leaving a voicemail on someone's cell phone is non-interactive.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Lastly, in speaking, we might make a difference between speaking that is planned, such as at a wedding or in a school play, or speaking that is unplanned or spontaneous, like when we run into someone at the store.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            We can describe speaking in terms of purpose (largely transactional), participation (interactive) and planning (partly planned) an event such as a job interview.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            However, being that these distinctions are not absolute, we may find that some speaking in a job interview may be for the sole purpose of maintaining and sustaining good interpersonal relations, as most interviewees plan out what they are going to say, just as interviewers plan their questions ahead of time. If we can think of speaking in terms or purpose, participation and planning, it will help us provide activities in speaking from all six categories and in different combinations of each.

                            Face-to-face interaction depends on knowledge and successful execution of turn-taking, furthermore, speakers use various discourse markers to buy time (ummm … well … you know …), to start a turn in the conversation (well … I'd just like to say … ) or to signal the beginning or the end of a segment (right … now … anyway ...).

                            To be successful in face-to-face conversation students must be able to ask for repetition using formulaic expressions, repeating up to the point where there was a breakdown in conversation. Along with these repair strategies, such abilities as paraphrasing (It's a kind of …), using an all-purpose phrase to get around a problem of not knowing a word (You know, it's a what-d'you-call-it), and being able to ask for help (What's the word for … ?) can be added.

                            When students are involved in one on one conversation outside the classroom, it is usually with competent English language speakers, so they need to be exposed to more then just the questions found in coursebooks if they are to be able to communicate spontaneously.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            For students to be aware of what real conversation looks like, other then that of question reformulation strategies (e.g. Did you consider the possibility of an alliance with other organizations?) that are directed at more advanced language learners, we can get them to analyze transcripts of real speech, giving them help using some of the more important phrases in English, and directing their attention to how speakers ask questions, and respond to the questions of others.

                        <Paragraph>
                            A lot of language is made up of phrases or colloquial language such as "Catch you later", "Back in a sec.", "Can I call you back in a couple of minutes?" etc. These pop up in many functional exchanges, so we can offer people things such as a drink, a coffee, etc., by saying, "Would you like a …?" Can I get you a … ?"
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Because they follow a set pattern, these exchanges work well. An adjacency paired response is one such when someone says to you, "Nice day isn't it?" they expect a paired response, such as, "Yes, it is." Or if we say, "Can I make you a tea?" the adjacency pair is either, "Yes, please." or "No, thank you."

                        <Paragraph>
                            We can have our students look at transcripts of typical exchanges and watch film clips to see this kind of language in use because we need to make students aware of such fixed phrases, functional sequences and adjacency pairs when teaching English.

                            If we give students a suitable topic and task, and the class atmosphere is good, we can get students to speak in class fairly easily. But there are times when we choose the wrong topic or perhaps the class mix is undesirable to the students, so we'll find it hard to get the students motivated. When dealing with reluctant students that don't want to speak or take part, the teacher's role here is crucial.

                            Students that are not predisposed to expressing themselves in front of other people or that are otherwise shy are often reluctant to speak, especially when personal information or opinions are being asked for. These students also worry about losing face in front of their classmates if they speak badly. In these situations we can help by doing a number of things.

                            Students perform much better if they have a chance to think about what they are going to say and how they are going to say it. We can let them practice dialogues in pairs or just give them some quiet time to think about how they might speak before they go out in public.

                            By practicing in one's own head, for example, students can practice giving directions to a taxi driver when they're on the bus, or they can just practice having conversations with themselves in different situations, such as describing how they would like their hair cut.

                        <Paragraph>
                            As we know, repetition has numerous beneficial effects as each new encounter with a word or phrase helps fix it into a student's memory. It also allows students to improve what they did before, how they can re-word things or just get a feel for how it sounds.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            With each repetition of a student's speaking task, the student gains more confidence, because they are more comfortable as they are not attempting to get the words out for the first time. Repetition works even better if a student is able to analyze what they have done. By letting students rehearse conversational exchanges by planning, performing, analyzing, and repeating, they will do it much more comfortably and fluently the second time.

                            A common reason that students are reluctant to take part in speaking activities is that they aren't too keen on big groups. If we can get them to interact in smaller groups they'll have more opportunities to participate and practice their speaking.

                            There are times when our students are going to get lost, can't think of anything to say, or are otherwise struggling on their own. We can leave them to work it out for themselves, however, we may be able to help the activity and the student to progress by offering discrete suggestions. If we can do this supportively, without disrupting the discussion or forcing students out of a role, it will stop the sense of frustration that students encounter when they come to a dead end of either language or ideas.

                            Participating in discussions and role-plays is a great way for teachers to ensure student engagement and maintain a creative atmosphere. However, teachers need to be careful not to participate too much, either by drawing too much attention to themselves or by dominating the speaking.

                        <Paragraph>
                            Engaging in one-on-one conversation creates special moments between the teacher and student as it allows them to talk together communicatively as near-equal participants. Again, we have to be careful so that students don't lose speaking opportunities.

                            Over-correction may inhibit them and take the communicativeness out of the activity. However, gentle and helpful correction may help the students out of difficult misunderstanding and hesitations.

                            It is vital that we allow students to assess what they have done after they have completed a task, and in our opinion, what went well.

                            When organizing a speaking task, it is of utmost importance that the students know exactly what it is they are supposed to do. By giving clear instructions and, where appropriate, demonstrating the activity with students so that no one has any doubt what they should be doing, we can ensure this.

                            We focus on developing speaking skills throughout our entire lesson. In the practice stage, our major focus is on developing fluency. It is at this stage in our lesson plan that we come up with different activities that work on developing speaking skills. We also work in class using whole class, small group, pair work and individual activities. By having activities where students have to interact among themselves, we are focusing in a student-centered classroom and the students are at center stage.

                            If you have been speaking for more than 3 minutes, then the center of attention is you and not the student. You already know how to speak English and your students don´t. Try to focus on having your students do the talking. Remember that our role at this stage is to guide, lead and motivate our students to work on their speaking skills.

                            If your students do not work on speaking skills in the classroom (EFL setting), they will not have a chance to work on it at home. The only chance of speaking will be missed. Your major focus on an EFL class should be developing communicative skills and not grammar knowledge.

                            Don´t allow the use of the native language in the classroom. Initially your students will not have enough knowledge of English to able to communicate but do not use the native language to translate. Translation does not develop fluency. Translation tends to impede the acquisition of language and fluency. As your students progress in their level of learning, stop the use of the native language in the classroom.

                        <Paragraph>
                            An essential part of communicative teaching is the activities that are included in the class. Activities, in a very real sense, drive the class and determine whether it flows smoothly and succeeds or not. It is the teachers' responsibility to incorporate into their lesson plans opportunities for meaningful interaction among the students. Let's look at some of the characteristics of classroom activities that work well to generate communication.

                                    Well-constructed communicative activities require student-to-student interaction and communication of information. The teacher acts as the facilitator, not the main performer.

                                <Paragraph>
                                    Whenever considering use of an activity, teachers should ask themselves some important questions: What will my role be in this activity? Will my speaking dominate this activity, or will it encourage the students to speak to one another? If your answers to these questions indicate that the activity requires you to do the majority of the speaking, then, unless it is specifically a listening focus exercise, you should modify the activity to give the students greater chance to practice their oral skills.
                                </Paragraph>

                                    Effective communicative activities, while focusing on improving speaking and listening proficiency, are often actually multi-skill, with one skill reinforcing another. Indeed, an activity categorized under a particular skill, for example under "Listening Activities" or "Reading Activities," might sometimes involve another skill. The point is that the skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing are frequently integrated and practiced in a single communicative lesson.
                                    <LineBreak/>

                                <Paragraph>
                                    When creating a lesson plan, you can think in terms of integrating skills. For instance, a brief lecture by the teacher can offer focused practice in listening comprehension. Following the lecture, the students can speak about the subject of the lecture using the same vocabulary. Thus, the two skills reinforce each other. Likewise, a pre-reading, speaking-listening activity can prepare students to read a particular passage: Having discussed a topic, they can then read about it. This kind of reinforcement is very valuable in the learning process. Rarely do we learn anything from initial exposure. Instead, mastery often requires multiple contacts with a subject. Language learning is no different.

                                    Effective activities often involve the students getting up and physically moving around the classroom. This prevents students from getting sleepy, tuning out, and becoming disengaged, and instead invigorates their minds. It also gives the students the chance to speak with different members of the class, not just those classmates who sit close by.

                                    In traditional classrooms, the students stay glued to their chairs. This is fine in some situations, but having the students stand occasionally and move about gets the blood flowing, and often makes the learning process livelier and more fun. And when students have fun, they can learn better.

                                    The activities are contextualized in a variety of media, including stories, pictures, videos, and songs. Real-life situations and people, including students and their own lives, can also provide context. There are so many possible sources of materials. Teachers need to be made aware of how to apply these resources to their courses in order to make the classes more interactive and engaging. That is one of the main goals of this course.

                                    Communicative activities often involve an information gap between pairs of students, in which one student has some information that his or her partner does not have. These dynamic activities provide opportunities for students to bridge that information gap by transferring information from one person to another. The result is that, students can accomplish the goals of the activity only if they communicate information effectively and listen attentively.

                                    Successful activities frequently use materials that can teach the students not only the language but also something about the real world. The class can learn the language and simultaneously learn about culture, law, art, history, science, economics, or whatever. This makes the class more interesting.

                            Some classroom materials present fictitious stories. Stories often convey significant principles of life and can lead to very engaging class discussion. In this case, the teacher can follow up the stories with ways to relate them to the students' personal lives. When the language can be applied to the actual lives of the students, it becomes more real and thus more easily learned.

                            The main issue at hand during oral work is whether or not to correct students as they make mistakes. Mistakes may be numerous and in various areas (grammar, vocabulary choice, pronunciation of both words and correct stressing in sentences). On the other hand, correction of written work boils down to how much correction should be done. In other words, should teachers correct every single mistake, or should they give a value judgment and correct only major mistakes.

                            With oral mistakes made during class discussions, there are typically two schools of thought:

                        <List>
                            <ListItem Style="{StaticResource IndentedListItem}">
                                <Paragraph>Correct often and thoroughly</Paragraph>
                            </ListItem>
                            <ListItem Style="{StaticResource IndentedListItem}">
                                <Paragraph>Let students make mistakes</Paragraph>
                            </ListItem>
                        </List>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Sometimes, teachers refine their choice by choosing to let beginners make many mistakes while correcting advanced students often.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            However, many teachers are taking a third route these days. This third route might be called 'selective correction'. In this case, the teacher decides to correct only certain errors. Which errors will be corrected is usually decided by the objectives of the lesson, or the specific exercise that is being done at that moment. In other words, if students are focusing on simple past irregular forms, then only mistakes in those forms are corrected (i.e., goed, thinked, etc.). Other mistakes, such as mistakes in a future form, or mistakes of collocations (for example: I made my homework) are ignored.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Finally, many teachers also choose to correct students after the fact. Teachers take notes on common mistakes that students make. During the follow-up correction session the teacher then presents common mistakes made so that all can benefit from an analysis of which mistakes were made and why.
