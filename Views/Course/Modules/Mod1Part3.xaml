                            Grammar is a set of rules that make up a language. Grammar is also used as a term to refer to the prescriptive rules of a given language, which may change over time. The way people spoke in the 1700s is not the way we speak today. Languages are living organisms and evolve over time so grammar must also evolve and change over time.

                            Grammar may be separated into two common categories: descriptive and prescriptive. Both views of grammar are used today, although in general, linguists tend towards a descriptive approach to grammar, while people teaching a specific language (English) might tend towards a more prescriptive approach.

                            Descriptive Grammar
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            A descriptive grammar tries to look at the grammar of any language as it is actually used, judging whether a sentence is grammatical or not based on the rules of the speech group in which it is spoken, rather than the set of rules. For example, in many speech communities, a sentence such as, "Ya'll ain't getting' that," would be entirely grammatical, and an entire set of rules of grammar can be deduced that explain why that formation is used. In another speech community, however, that sentence might be considered ungrammatical. The only accepted version such as, "You are not getting that," would be considered acceptable.

                            Prescriptive Grammar
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            A prescriptive grammar covers the norms of speech as given by authoritative sources, such as an upper-class or academics, and creates strict rules by which all speech within that language must abide to be considered grammatical. Few linguists take a prescriptive approach to grammar in modern times, preferring to describe language as it exists in a given speech community. Many teachers and pedagogues, however, still use a prescriptive approach towards grammar, adhering to standardized rules as being the only proper way to speak.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Prescriptive grammar is also used to some extent in teaching a language to nonnative speakers. When teaching English, for example, it can be useful to employ a standard form of English as a baseline to teach from. This usually helps reduce confusion among students. Once the language has been acquired, of course, a less-prescriptive approach will necessarily take over, as the non-native speaker learns regional rules and new dialects that may not conform to the prescriptive grammar he or she originally learned.

                        <Paragraph>
                            Parts of speech are very important in grammar since they are the groups in which words are categorized. They allow you to label a word in a sentence and provide the framework for the rules to follow in a sentence. Learn these parts of speech and be able to label or name a part of speech in a sentence.

                            In this objective, we will cover the 12 tenses in the English language and provide you with examples, the formula and key time expressions. Tenses are the foundation of the language. One of the challenges that you will face when teaching English is that students will challenge you to see how much you know about grammar. They want to know if you really know the tenses and their formulas. It is helpful if you are able to explain them clearly and effectively.

                        <Paragraph>
                            If you are a native speaker, you have been exposed to the language since birth. If you are not a native speaker, then this was the first information that you learned. Whether you are a native speaker or not, knowing this information is extremely important, and it is also an essential part of the graded for this course. At the end of this objective you should have learned the tenses, be able to provide examples, the formula and the use of the tense. If you were to compare the tenses to a house, the tenses would be the beams of a house. The tenses would be the columns that hold the structure together.

                            We highly recommend that you purchase a grammar book (online or paper-back). Make sure that it is a grammar book for teachers and not for students. A grammar book is a vital tool that all teachers should have when preparing their lessons plans. To learn these tenses I would recommend that you write sample sentences, underneath write the formula and compare them to the information here.
