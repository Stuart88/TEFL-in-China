                        <Paragraph>
                            The best organizations and projects are founded by experienced people with passion for the field in which they operate. Martin Bragalone and MC Miller are two Americans, born and raised in neighboring small-towns in the so-called, "American Rustbelt”, who wanted more options for their careers and social influences than that which the regional automotive and manufacturing industries could provide at the time. During university, their only contact was in foreign language learning programs. Outside of social media, they had little contact in the first few years after graduation. Going on their separate international paths, Martin traveled to Japan and MC to China.

                        <Paragraph>
                            Teaching languages has been influenced by linguistics and psychology throughout history. Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research has been evolutionary and many great scholars have proposed wonderful ideas which were new and ideal at that time but have now fallen by the wayside. In this article we will learn about some of the methods proposed through time, and you will learn some of the fundamental points that can be used in the classroom today.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Contemporaneously, Martin and MC had engaged with the education industries in their respective new homes in East Asia for many years, and they eventually crossed paths in China. Keeping contact after their reunion, they consulted with one another regularly on how to be an effective teacher and education professional in East Asia. That drive for improving their craft brought them to create this educational organization and the TEFL courses offered.

                            Foreword by Martin Bragalone

                        <Paragraph>
                            Hi there. My name is Martin Bragalone. I am an American who has been living and traveling primarily in Asia for the past 11 years as I teach, design curriculums and run schools.
                        </Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph>
                            My journey started with a simple dream to travel the world and learn as many languages as I could along the way. Learning and L2 acquisition theory has been my greatest passion for the past 20 years. In 2009 I studied Linguistics via the Spanish language in Costa Rica and shortly after, studied for one year in Japan. I later returned to Japan where I taught English. I started at a Montessori international kindergarten and later found my way to Tokyo teaching adults. Over time, I moved towards a career of Japanese to English translation &amp; Interpretation. After 6 years in Japan, I found myself in Southeast Asia, China, Europe and back.
                        </Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph>
                            What I have learned in these years pursuing over 10 languages is that, if you know the principles behind the acquisition process, all you need to do is identity the processes that line up with those principles which you enjoy best. Next, you simply follow the process without question over a period of time and the results will come. Knowing this as a learner has drastically changed the way in which I approach education as an instructor of foreign languages. I see the "teacher” more as a guide helping the students to discover, to grow and create while following simple processes which always work.
                        </Paragraph>


                        <Paragraph>
                            Just as there are simple processes to follow to learn languages, there is also a simple process to achieve your dream to travel the world and build wealth as you do. My partner, MC, and I would like to present to you one simple way forward to help you achieve that end.

                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            I have always been an avid learner, curious about the nature of the world and my place in it. Early on it became apparent to me that through both top-down as well as bottom-up, "grassroots”, forces, the world was becoming increasingly interconnected. It amazed me to witness the birth of the internet as a young man and to observe as the nations of the world began to come online with internet access and, perhaps more importantly, they brought their economies online. Many reformed their laws and institutions, for better or worse, to reflect the changing circumstances they found themselves in.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Having been brought up in a so-called, "developed country”, I felt on the outside looking into this fascinating world of change. Despite myriad challenges, prosperity and education was spreading to corners of the world once believed to be relegated to persistent poverty far into the indeterminable future. Looking back three decades ago, a place like central China was once only to be discovered in the pages of Natural Geographic, for example. More recently, I have been to central China. I have been going back and forth to there and other regions of the country for nearly a decade now. I met other non-Chinese there who had been making lives for themselves for many years even prior to my arrival, and the numbers of expats are growing. It is no longer novel to speak Chinese as a second language, as I do, and my journey, as has that of many, began with entering the education industry. I became TEFL certified as my first step in engaging with the outside world off-line, and it was only the first step of many.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            To my understanding and judging by my personal experience, becoming TEFL certified is a common and useful means to begin a career either as a professional English teacher abroad, whether in China, as I did, or elsewhere, or it could be the key that opens the door to another adventure you might not even know is available to you, waiting for you just beyond your own national borders.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            I wish you the best in your personal journey and in your career endeavors.
